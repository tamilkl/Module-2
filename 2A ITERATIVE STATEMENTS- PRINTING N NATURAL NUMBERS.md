## ITERATIVE STATEMENTS â€“  PRINTING N NATURAL NUMBERS

###  Aim
To create a Python program for printing n natural numbers using a for loop.
###  Algorithm

1.Begin the program.
2.Use input() to read the value of n (the upper limit) from the user.
3.Convert the input to an integer.
4.Display the message "Natural Numbers are :".
5.Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to n (inclusive).
6.In each iteration, print the current value of i.
7.Terminate the program.
###  Program

```python
a=int(input())
print("Natural Numbers are :")
for i in range(1,a+1):
    print(i)

```
